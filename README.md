Tools & Technologies:- Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Data Modeling, Data Visualization, Forecasting

Project Overview:-
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze investment portfolios and transaction-level data, providing actionable insights into asset allocation, transaction trends, risk exposure, and overall portfolio performance.

Key Contributions & Insights:-

Portfolio Performance: Tracked a ₹10.5M invested amount with a current portfolio value of ₹11.7M, identifying a 11.43% overall ROI.

Growth Trends: Calculated a CAGR of 8.2% across the portfolio, with YoY performance showing positive growth in 3 of the last 4 years.
Transaction Analysis: Analyzed over 1,200+ transactions, highlighting buy vs. sell trends; uncovered that 65% of profits came from equity trades while bonds provided stable returns.

Risk Analysis: Segmented portfolio into low, medium, and high-risk categories, showing that high-risk assets contributed 40% of total returns but carried the largest volatility.

Sector & Asset Allocation: Visualized exposure across 7 sectors and 4 asset classes, revealing IT and Finance as the strongest contributors, while Energy lagged behind.

Geographic Insights: Used mapping to track investments across 12 states, identifying Maharashtra and Karnataka as top-performing regions.

Forecasting: Added predictive analytics to project portfolio growth for the next 6 months, showing an expected 5–7% upward trend.
Scenario Analysis: Implemented What-if parameters to simulate investment strategy changes (e.g., increasing equity allocation by 10% would raise ROI by ~2%).

Impact:-

This dashboard provided a 360° view of portfolio health, enabling stakeholders to:

Reallocate investments toward higher-performing sectors.

Manage risk exposure effectively across asset classes.

Plan future strategies using forecasting and scenario simulations.
